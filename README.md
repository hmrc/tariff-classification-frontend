# tariff-classification-frontend

The frontend for the internal Advance Tariff Rulings Case Manager service for reviewing & answering ATaR applications.

### Running

##### To run this Service you will need:

1) [Service Manager 2](https://github.com/hmrc/sm2) installed
2) [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org) Version `>=1.x` installed
3) [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) version `>=6.0` installed and running on port 27017
4) [Localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) installed and running on port 4572
5) Create an S3 bucket in localstack by using `awslocal s3 mb s3://digital-tariffs-local` within the localstack container

The easiest way to run MongoDB and Localstack for local development is to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

##### To run Localstack and create the S3 bucket

```
> docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name localstack -e SERVICES=s3 -p4572:4566 -p8080:8080 localstack/localstack
> docker exec -it localstack bash
> awslocal s3 mb s3://digital-tariffs-local
> exit
```

#### Starting the application:

Launch services using `sm2 --start DIGITAL_TARIFFS`

If you want to run it locally:

- `sm2 --stop TARIFF_CLASSIFICATION_FRONTEND`
- `sbt run`

This application runs on port 9581.

Open `http://localhost:9581/manage-tariff-classifications`.

### Authentication

The service uses the HMRC [auth-client](https://github.com/hmrc/auth-client) for authentication with STRIDE as the authentication provider. In non production environments you will be redirected to the stride-idp-stub. You can log in using the following enrolment information:

PID: `<any string>`

to log in as a classification team officer:

Roles: `classification`

and as a classification team manager:

Roles: `classification-manager`

and as a read-only user:

Roles: `classification-read-only`

### PDF Generation

When running the unit tests, some PDFs are generated at **/test/resources/fop** using Apache FOP. These should be used to check for regressions in the layout of the PDFs generated by the service.

### Testing

Run `./run_all_tests.sh`. This also runs scalafmt and does coverage testing.

or `sbt test` to run the tests only.
